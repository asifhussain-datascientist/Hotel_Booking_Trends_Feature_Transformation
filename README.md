# Hotel Booking Trends - Feature Transformation

# Overview
This project aims to analyze and transform features related to hotel booking trends. By applying feature engineering and data transformations, we aim to gain insights into booking patterns and prepare the data for further modeling tasks such as prediction or clustering.

# Key Features
* **Dataset**: The project utilizes data related to hotel bookings.
* **Objective**: Feature transformation and analysis to optimize for downstream tasks (e.g., machine learning).
* 
# Tools Used:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
* Scikit-learn for feature transformation

# Project Structure
* Hotel Booking Trends Feature Transformation.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing code for:
* Data Loading and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering (handling missing values, categorical encoding, etc.)
* Data Visualization

# Usage
* Open the notebook and run the cells step-by-step to transform and analyze the hotel booking data.
* Modify any transformation techniques or feature engineering methods according to your use case.
* Integrate the transformed data into downstream machine learning models or use it for detailed analysis.

# Results
**Data Preprocessing:**
Missing values were handled using appropriate techniques.
Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding and label encoding as necessary.
**Data Transformation:**
Feature scaling and normalization applied to relevant columns.
Derived new features to enhance predictive power.

# Future Work
**Modeling**: Use the transformed data to build machine learning models for predicting booking cancellations or segmenting customers.
Improved Feature Engineering: Explore more advanced feature selection and creation techniques.
